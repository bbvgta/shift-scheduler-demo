⛪ Volunteer Shift Scheduler Prototype

This is a simple web app built to help pastors and church administrators schedule volunteers for shifts or events and check in with them based on mood surveys.

The goal is to help churches support volunteers better, catch early signs of burnout, and streamline scheduling for small ministry teams.

🌟 Features

🗓 Volunteer Scheduling

Add or remove volunteers from event shifts

Cancel or undo cancellations

Add new volunteers instantly

😄 Mood Tracking & Admin Alerts
Volunteers can log their mood after serving.
The system automatically flags patterns:

Good (😊) — If good for 5 shifts in a row ➝ schedule a day off and send a text check-in.

Okay (😐) — If okay for 3 shifts in a row ➝ schedule a day off and face-to-face check-in.

Bad (😞) — If bad for 2 shifts ➝ schedule a day off, face-to-face meeting, and alert the Mercy Team to offer support.

🧰 Admin Tools

🧭 Why This Matters

Volunteers are the backbone of church ministry. This app helps:

Pastors keep track of morale

Admins schedule smarter

Mercy Teams offer help proactively

Volunteers feel seen and supported — not just scheduled.

This can build healthier volunteer culture and encourage more people to serve.
